We made the following changes in the final version of the paper:

* Added more comments in the related work section on relationship to
  Cartmell's generalised algebraic theories and the FoSSaCS 2018 paper
  about QIITs

* Addressed small suggestions by reviewers (mostly typos, changes in
  notation, adding one-sentence clarifications)
